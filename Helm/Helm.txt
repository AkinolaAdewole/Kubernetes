WHAT IS HELM?

Helm is widely known as "the package manager for Kubernetes". 
Although it presents itself like this, its scope goes way beyond that of a simple package manager.


Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes applications. It helps you define, install, and manage even the most
 complex Kubernetes applications. Helm is designed to simplify the deployment and management of Kubernetes applications by providing
  a standardized way to package, distribute, and manage applications and their dependencies.

A Helm chart is a package format used in Kubernetes for describing and deploying applications and their associated resources. 
It provides a way to define, install, and manage Kubernetes applications in a repeatable and consistent manner. 
Helm charts abstract the complexity of defining Kubernetes resources individually and allow you to package everything needed for an 
application into a single, versioned unit.

HERE ARE SOME KEY CONCEPTS RELATED TO HELM:

1. Charts: In Helm, a package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources is called a "Chart." 
A Chart can include multiple Kubernetes manifests, templates, and values that allow you to customize the deployment of your application.

2. Templates: Charts include templates that define the Kubernetes resources required for your application. 
These templates can be parameterized using values that are specified when you install the Chart.

3. Values: Values are configuration options that are used to customize the behavior of a Chart when it's installed. 
They can include things like configuration settings, environment variables, and more.

4. Repository: Helm Charts can be stored in repositories, which are collections of Charts that you can pull from when 
you want to deploy an application. Public repositories like the official Helm Hub or private repositories can be used.

5. Release: When you install a Chart, it creates a Kubernetes deployment called a "Release." Releases are instances of a 
Chart that are running in your cluster.

Using Helm, you can avoid writing extensive Kubernetes YAML manifests for each application you deploy. 
Instead, you can define and customize applications using Helm Charts, making deployment, version management, and 
maintenance more streamlined.

TO USE HELM:

Install Helm on your local machine or within your development environment.
Create or use existing Helm Charts that define your Kubernetes applications.
Customize the Charts using values or parameterized templates.
Install the Chart into your Kubernetes cluster, creating a Release.
Helm is a valuable tool for managing Kubernetes applications, especially as your projects become more complex and involve 
multiple components and configurations. It's widely adopted within the Kubernetes community and provides a higher level of abstraction 
for managing deployments.
