A Helm chart is a package format for defining, installing, and managing Kubernetes applications. 
Helm charts are often used to define the structure of Kubernetes resources and their configurations in a reusable and versioned manner. 
Below is an overview of the typical structure of a Helm chart directory:

my-chart/
  │
  ├── charts/
  │   ├── (subcharts, if your chart includes dependencies)
  │   ├── ...
  │
  ├── templates/
  │   ├── deployment.yaml
  │   ├── service.yaml
  │   ├── ingress.yaml
  │   ├── ...
  │
  ├── values.yaml
  ├── Chart.yaml
  └── (other optional files and directories)


Let's break down each of these components:

1. MY-CHART/: This is the root directory of your Helm chart, and its name should match the name of your chart.

2. CHARTS/: This directory contains subcharts, which are Helm charts that your chart depends on. You can include subcharts to modularize 
your application's components.

3. TEMPLATES/: This directory contains Kubernetes resource manifests in YAML format. These templates define the resources that Helm will 
generate when you install the chart. Common resources include Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, and Ingresses.

4. VALUES.YAML: This file defines default configuration values for your chart. Users can override these values when installing the chart, 
allowing for customization. You can also include comments and explanations in this file.

5.CHART.YAML: This file provides metadata about your chart, including its name, version, description, and maintainer. 
It's essential for Helm to understand the chart and manage its releases.

Other optional files and directories: Depending on your chart's needs, you might include additional files and directories for custom 
scripts, configuration files, or documentation.

Here's a brief explanation of how these components work together:

When you run helm install, Helm processes the templates in the templates/ directory, using the values from values.yaml.

Helm generates Kubernetes manifests based on the templates and values and deploys them to your Kubernetes cluster.

Users can override default values in values.yaml by providing a custom values.yaml file when installing the chart.

Dependencies on other charts are specified in requirements.yaml, and Helm can fetch and manage those dependencies.

Overall, the Helm chart structure allows you to define and package your Kubernetes applications in a standardized way, making it easier 
to share, version, and deploy applications on Kubernetes clusters.
